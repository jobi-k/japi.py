# Hi, well done, you made it. This is the final lesson.

# You now know how to complete each task of a predictive modeling machine learning problem.

# In today's lesson, you need to practice putting the pieces together and work through a standard machine learning dataset end-to-end.
# Work through the iris dataset end-to-end (the "hello world" of machine learning).
# This includes the steps:
# Understanding your data using descriptive statistics and visualization.
# Pre-Processing the data to best expose the structure of the problem.
# Spot-checking a number of algorithms using your own test harness.
# Improving results using algorithm parameter tuning.
# Improving results using ensemble methods.
# Finalize the model ready for future use.
# Take your time and have fun with it!
#
# Next, I will touch base with you and see how you're going.
